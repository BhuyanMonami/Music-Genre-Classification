# Music-Genre-Classification
Deep learning algorithms such as CNN and RNN have played a major role in acoustic modeling in recent years. In this project, different features of audio files are explored. Both deep learning and classical machine learning algorithms are used to map the extracted features from music files to their respective genre.  Specifically, SVM, XGBoost, CNN, LSTM and ResNet50 are used to match the patterns in the feature space to a specific genre. Pushing the accuracy measure of the current SOTA is also an objective. The features were extracted from the available GTZAN music dataset and exploratory data analysis was performed for the same. The models were then trained and evaluated the performance using common performance matrices against the XGBoost baseline model.
